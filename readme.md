    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend:**
    * Navigate to the backend directory:
        ```sh
        cd backend
        ```
    * Install dependencies:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```
    * Create a `.env` file in the `backend` root and add your MongoDB connection string:
        ```env
        # .env
        MONGO_URI=
        PORT=5000
        ```

3.  **Setup the Frontend:**

    * Install dependencies:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```
    *The frontend is pre-configured with a Vite proxy to communicate with the backend server.*

### **Running the Application**

You'll need to run both the backend and frontend servers simultaneously in separate terminals.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    * In the `backend` directory:
        ```sh
        npm run dev
        ```
    * The server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    * In the `frontend` directory:
        ```sh
        npm run dev
        ```
    * The application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.
